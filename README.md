# Interactive Convolutional Visualization

Visit here for [a demo show](https://tinymilky.github.io/demos/conv/index.html).  

This is a Javascript implementations for ineractive convolutional visualization, which could help you understand the details of how convolution works, how to implement a convolution operation from scratch, how to use [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to visualize everything.

## Useful Features to Learn

* Code is purely based on javascript and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/);
* Good chance to put what you have learn in js and D3 into practice;
* Details in every single step of convolution and its visualization;
* Extendable to reveal more advanced convolution concepts.

The following is the [demo](https://tinymilky.github.io/demos/conv/index.html):
